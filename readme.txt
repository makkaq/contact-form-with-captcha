A simple plugin for your WordPress blog that enables you to have a contact form with the reCAPTCHA challenge system.

All you have to do is install and activate the plugin, enter your reCAPTCHA keys in the Admin section, and place the 
shortcode `[cfwc]` on any page or post within your blog.

The form asks users for their name, email address, subject and message.  The plugin will validate email address before sending 
the email.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where Can I Use The reCAPTCHA Form? =

You can use it in any post or page by inserting the shortcode `[cfwc]`

= I Don't Have Any reCAPTCHA Keys.  Where Can I Get Them From? =

You can get them from the Google reCAPTCHA website(http://www.google.com/recaptcha/whyrecaptcha "Google reCAPTCHA website").

= Can I Use This Plugin With Other Plugins That Use reCAPTCHA? =

reCAPTCHA Form can be installed alongside any other plugins that use the reCAPTCHA challenge system, however you must 
make sure that whatever post/page you insert the reCAPTCHA Form shortcode on does not already display a reCAPTCHA 
form - this is because you cannot display more than one reCAPTCHA form on the same web page.
